If you're using Relay for the first time, follow our [Getting started](getting-started.md) guide to familiarize yourself with key Relay concepts and learn your way around.

To start authoring your own Relay workflows, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you've got an activated account and can [log in to the Relay service](https://app.relay.sh).
1. Install the [Relay command line interface](https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay#installation).
1. [Pick a reference workflow](reference-workflows.md) to use as a starting point.
1. Modify your reference workflow to your heart's desire, then [run it on Relay](using-workflows/running-a-workflow.md).

If you're looking for reference material on workflows and steps, we've got you covered:

- [Relay workflows](reference/relay-workflows.md)
- [Relay template expressions](reference/relay-expressions.md)
- [Relay template functions](reference/relay-functions.md)
- For developers, information on building new [steps](developers/step-authoring.md) and [integrations](developers/integrating-with-relay.md)

If you get stuck or need help, we're here for you. You can:

- Log on to the [Puppet Community Slack instance](https://slack.puppet.com) and join the developers and community in #relay
- File a Github issue in the [@puppetlabs/relay](https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay/issues/new/choose) repository.
